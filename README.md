# Multilayer Plastic Waste Pollution Analysis 

## Overview
"Multilayer Plastic Waste Pollution Analysis in North America" is an insightful project, focusing on the pressing issue of plastic waste in north america pollution in coastal regions of the United States. The project employs a data-driven approach to quantify, analyze, and propose solutions for mitigating this environmental challenge.

## Objectives
- Analyze the scale and impact of multilayer plastic waste in coastal areas.
- Identify major contributors to plastic pollution and understand their roles.
- Utilize predictive analytics, specifically a Random Forest model, to classify waste materials.
- Develop actionable strategies based on analytical findings to reduce pollution.

## Key Findings
- A significant portion of plastic pollution is attributed to multilayer plastics, which pose recycling challenges.
- Unbranded products contribute considerably to pollution, highlighting a policy and management gap.
- The Random Forest model, enhanced with the SMOTE technique, achieved a classification accuracy of 0.81.
- Strategies recommended include policy reforms, technological improvements, and shifts in consumer behavior.
